OVER and PARTITION BY. These are key to window functions. Not every window function uses PARTITION BY; we can also use ORDER BY or no statement at all depending on the query we want to run. You will practice using these clauses in the upcoming quizzes. If you want more details right now, this resource from Pinal Dave is helpful.
