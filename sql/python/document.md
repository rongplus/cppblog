Documentation and Books to Build Your NLP Knowledge

Congratulations on enrolling in Natural Language Processing. We’re excited that you’re here. To help you during your learning journey, we’re sharing with you a set of resources. These resources include popular developer resources on the web, as well as recommended, optional books that can be used to supplement our Codecademy content.

Popular NLP Resources
As you go through the path, we’ll suggest certain resources for you to use, like articles, videos, tutorials, and documentation. Here are some additional resources that are considered groundbreaking, significant, or classics in the industry and will help you throughout your Path:

Documentation: NLTK
Documentation: re
Documentation: spaCy
Documentation: gensim
Documentation: scikit-learn: Working with Text Data
Documentation: TensorFlow
Go ahead and bookmark these resources—you won’t need them now, but they’ll be useful to reference and use as you go through the Path.

Recommended Books
Codecademy prides itself on its interactive lessons, but sometimes it’s useful to have a couple of books on hand. The books featured in this Path are considered classics in the industry and many Codecademy learners (and employees!) have found them useful.

Book: Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism, Safiya Umoja Noble
Book: Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft), Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin
Book: Deep Learning with Python, François Chollet
While the books listed are recommended and will help you on your NLP journey, purchasing and reading them is optional. When possible, we’ve suggested a free alternative. The content covers many of the same topics that you’ll find in our own lessons, but may be useful for those who want more explanation, a different perspective, or other opportunities for practice.

For those who choose to use them, relevant chapters and sections are woven throughout the syllabus. For those who are not using them, when you encounter a content item that is a reading, click the ‘Next’ button to move forward to the next content item. It will still count towards your overall progress, meaning that you do not need to purchase and read the books to complete this Path and receive a certificate.

Best of luck!
